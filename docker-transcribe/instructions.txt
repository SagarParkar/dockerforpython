WHEN WORKING LOCALLY IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

    RUN EACH COMMAND
    python3.10 -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

    GO TO: http://0.0.0.0:8080/

    WAIT FOR LESS THAN 30 SECONDS
    You will see the transcription on the homepage
    And a new file in the project directory called '123456789.txt'
    The app is done. It worked properly. 

WHEN WORKING WITH DOCKER

    RUN
    docker build -t <image-name>:<version-name> .

    RUN
    docker run --name <container-name> -p 8080:8080 <image-name>:<version-tag>

    GO TO: http://0.0.0.0:8080/

    THE EXACT SAME CODE NOW TAKES 20-50 MINUTES TO FINISH
    This is the problem I need you to fix
